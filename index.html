        <h2 id="Number1">The sport</h2>
    <p class="tennis">Tennis is the sport well-known in the world,
        is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single
        opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).
        Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a
        hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the
        opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such
        a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player 
        who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the 
        opposite player will. </p>

        <h2 id="Number2">My experience</h2>
    <p class="experience">My first time meeting with the sport was at the age of 6
             because of my parents who wanted me to be active. At first
             I didn't enjoy playing it but after time it started to grow
             on me. After two years of training I was feeling confident
             of my skills and I started to play tournaments.</p>

             <h2 id="Number3">My achievments</h2>
    <p class="tournaments">After I decided to start participating in tournaments I 
        started to enjoy the sport even more and after playing on my clubs courts
        I got an invitation to play away. How could I say no to that, so I packed and 
        went to win the tournament with my parents in Truskavets at that time I was 9
        years old. Down below you can see some of my tournaments and where did I place in them:</p>
        <table class="tournaments">

            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Cities</th>
                    <th>Place</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Truskavets</td>
                <td>1st</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Kraków</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>1st</td>
            </tr>

                <td>Krzeszowice</td>
                <td>3rd</td>

        </table>

        <h2 id="Number4">My inspiration</h2>
        <p class="proffesional">Ever since I got interested in Tennis I started
            watching other tennis players play and the one player I found 
            inspiiring was Novak Djokovic. He is a Serbian professional tennis
            player who is currently ranked world No. 1 in men's singles tennis
            by the Association of Tennis Professionals. He inspired me to become
            better and to play with your mind and not muscle.</p>
